
Snake 15

Now it remains to finish the snake.

Here's what I suggest about snake movement:
The snake consists of pieces. Come on every move, just add one piece on the side of the head,
and the last one to delete. Then it turns out that the snake is crawling.

Let's add two move methods, one with no parameters, and the other with two parameters of type int.

In the move method without parameters, you must:

a) stop moving if the snake is dead (isAlive == false)
b) call the move (0, -1) method if the direction of movement is equal to SnakeDirection. UP.
c) call the move (1, 0) method if the direction of movement is equal to SnakeDirection. RIGHT.
d) call the move (0, 1) method if the direction of movement is equal to SnakeDirection. DOWN.
e) call the move (-1, 0) method if the direction of movement is equal to SnakeDirection. Left.
